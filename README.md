#### Brief Description of Project - The Biscuit Industry faces various challenges to stabilize its production and sales. The 
cost of raw materials, ingredients, and manufacturing is going up day by day, whereas 
the price point of selling the output has remained the same for many years. Therefore, 
biscuit manufacturers must identify a new strategy to keep the demand-supply ration 
tag. It is also essential to introduce premium production for domestic and international 
markets to create new members to increase revenue. Challenges,
 Challenge 1: Volatility in Raw Material Prices.
 Challenge 2: Low acceptance of mid & Premium segment biscuits in Rural Areas 
of the country which constitutes around two-third of the population.
 Challenge 3: Highly Fragmented Market.
 Challenge 4: Lack of Exclusive Retail Distribution Channel
#### Technologies used - MERN – Mongo DB | Express Js | React Js | Node Js
